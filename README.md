# 🚀 DevOps & AWS Practice Repository

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in Git, DevOps fundamentals, and AWS operations.  
All work here is created manually to reflect real-world engineering workflows.

## 💻 What I Practiced
- Git repository initialization and navigation
- File tracking vs ignored files
- Usage of `.gitignore` to maintain repository hygiene
- Clean commit practices followed in production systems

## ⚡ Why This Matters
- Sensitive and local files must never be pushed
- Clean repositories are critical for CI/CD pipelines
- Engineers must think about security and scalability from day one

## 🔥 Next Steps
- AWS IAM and EC2 hands-on practice
- Linux command-line operations
- CI/CD fundamentals

> Built step-by-step with intent to reflect real engineering discipline.
