# DevOps & AWS Practice Repository

## Purpose
This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in Git, DevOps fundamentals, and AWS operations.
All work here is created manually to understand real-world engineering workflows.

## What I Practiced
- Git repository initialization and navigation
- File tracking vs ignored files
- Usage of `.gitignore` to maintain repository hygiene
- Clean commit practices followed in production systems

## Why This Matters
In real-world DevOps and cloud environments:
- Sensitive and local files must never be pushed
- Clean repositories are critical for CI/CD pipelines
- Engineers must think about security and scalability from day one

This repository reflects an operational mindset, not tutorial copying.

## Next Steps
- AWS IAM and EC2 hands-on practice
- Linux command-line operations
- CI/CD fundamentals

> Built step-by-step with intent to reflect real engineering discipline.
